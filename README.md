# javalab
This project provides branches with various examples, how-to's, and best practices.

One of the most useful is the **basic** branch which lets you immediately start writing Java for quick prototyping. The idea behind this was to make jumping into Java as quick as it is in Python when opening the Python interpreter.

I found myself going to Python first because of how easy it is to start coding without any prior setup. Now I use the javalab project nearly as frequently.
